# In this code, we assign certain values to variables and the print them
# Variables are the refrences to the physical storage in which code stores
# the data on temporary basis i.e. till the program is running or we
# intentionally wipe out data through code

fullName = "Ajjay Aroraa" # This is an example of how to store string type data
someRandomNumber = 10 # This is an example of how to store integer type data
is_val_true = False # This is an example of how to store boolean type data


print(fullName)
print(someRandomNumber)
print(is_val_true)

# A variable name in pyton should start either with underscore or a letter but
# not with the number. Also, only letters, underscore, and numbers are allowed
# Do note that variable names are case sensitive. So, FULLNAME is not same as
# fullName or FullName or fullname and so on


# If at any point of time you want to know what type of data is stored in a
# variable, you can use below code

print(type(fullName))
print(type(someRandomNumber))
print(type(is_val_true))

# What it does is to print the type of data that is stored in a variable
